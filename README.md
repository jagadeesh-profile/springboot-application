# Spring Boot WAR Deployment with Jenkins CI/CD (Windows Guide)

## Project Overview

This documentation explains how to configure a Spring Boot application for WAR deployment and set up a Jenkins pipeline for automated builds and deployments on Windows systems.

## Spring Boot WAR Configuration

### Packaging Configuration

To prepare the Spring Boot application for WAR deployment, modify your project's build configuration file. Change the packaging type to WAR by updating the packaging property.

### Servlet Container Dependency

Include the Tomcat starter dependency with a `"provided"` scope in your project dependencies.

### Application Class Modification

Extend your main application class from Spring Boot's servlet initializer class.

## Jenkins Pipeline Setup

### Prerequisites

Before configuring Jenkins, ensured the following steps:

* Jenkins installed and running on your Windows machine
* Java Development Kit (JDK) properly configured
* Apache Maven installed and available in system PATH
* Git client installed for source code management

### Jenkins Job Configuration
- configured Jenkins UI at: http://localhost:8082
1.  Create a new freestyle project in Jenkins
2.  Configure source code management to connect to your Git repository
3.  Set up build triggers according to your requirements
4.  Add a build step to execute Maven goals for clean package
5.  Configure post-build actions for WAR file deployment

### Deployment Configuration

Set up a post-build action to copy the generated WAR file from your project's target directory to Tomcat's webapps directory using a Windows batch script.

## Environment Setup
ðŸ§° Environment Setup
-Apache Tomcat
-Install Apache Tomcat
-Configured Apache TomCatServer at port http://localhost:8080/


Add the following to conf/tomcat-users.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-script"/>

### Tomcat Server

Install Apache Tomcat on your Windows machine and configure appropriate user roles for deployment. The `manager-script` role is required for automated deployments.



## Verification Steps

After pipeline execution:

1.  Check Jenkins console output for build success
2.  Verify WAR file appears in Tomcat's web applications directory
3.  Access your application through the configured Tomcat port

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues occured while implementing:

* Permission errors during file copy operations
* Port conflicts with other services
* Dependency resolution problems
* Deployment failures in Tomcat
